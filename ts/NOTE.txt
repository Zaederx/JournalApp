Remeber to always use defer for all of your script tags when referecing them on html in electron.
Prevents errors on buttons and other DOM object, for example : 
"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'onclick' of null at app.js:2"

Always use defer:
<script src="../js/app.js" defer></script>

instead of:
<script src="../js/app.js"></script>

to avoid this
